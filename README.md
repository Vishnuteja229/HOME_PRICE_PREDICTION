Home Price Prediction

Description
The Home Price Prediction project estimates the price of homes using a machine learning algorithm. The project utilizes a dataset downloaded from Kaggle and applies predictive modeling to provide price estimates based on various home features. The front-end UI is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end leverages Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, and Flask.

Tools & Technologies:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, Flask

Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
Matplotlib

Dataset: Kaggle dataset (Home Prices)

Features:
User-friendly interface for inputting home feature data.
Machine learning model that predicts home prices based on the input data.
Visualization of data trends and predictions using Matplotlib.
Backend powered by Flask to handle data and model interactions.

How to Use:
Launch the server in your computer
Input various features of the house (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) through the user interface.
The machine learning model will predict the price of the home based on the input data.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features related to house prices, such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, etc.
